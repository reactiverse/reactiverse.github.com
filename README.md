# Reactiverse

The _reactiverse_ community at https://reactiverse.io/ and https://github.com/reactiverse is a collection of open source projects that gravitate around the _Eclipse Vert.x_ and _reactive (system, programming and stream)_ communities.

While independent from the [Eclipse Vert.x](https://vertx.io/) project, the _reactiverse_ gathers useful quality projects that may serve the community of developers relying on Eclipse Vert.x.

All _reactiverse_ projects share the Maven group identifier `io.reactiverse`.

## Current Projects

* [ES4x](/es4x)
* [Eclipse Vert.x Maven Plugin](/vertx-maven-plugin)
* [Reactive Contexts](/reactive-contexts)
* [Elasticsearch client](/elasticsearch-client)
* [Consul Cluster Manager](/consul-cluster-manager)
* [AWS SDK](/aws-sdk)
* [Reactiverse Vert.x JUnit5 extensions](/reactiverse-junit5-extensions)
* [Reactiverse Contextual Logging](/reactiverse-contextual-logging)

All projects are maintained by the community, and we welcome both contributions and new project proposals.
