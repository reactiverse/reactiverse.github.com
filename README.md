# Reactiverse

The _reactiverse_ community at https://reactiverse.io/ and https://github.com/reactiverse is a collection of open source projects that gravitate around the _Eclipse Vert.x_ and _reactive (system, programming and stream)_ communities.

While independent from the [Eclipse Vert.x](https://vertx.io/) project, the _reactiverse_ gathers useful quality projects that may serve the community of developers relying on Eclipse Vert.x.

All _reactiverse_ projects share the Maven group identifier `io.reactiverse`.

## Current Projects

* [Reactive PG client](/reactive-pg-client)
* [ES4x](/es4x)
* [Eclipse Vert.x Maven Plugin](/vertx-maven-plugin)
* [Reactive Contexts](/reactive-contexts)

All projects are maintained by the community, and we welcome both contributions and new project proposals.

## Governance

The governance (including how to propose a new project) can be found at https://github.com/reactiverse/reactiverse/.
